# Clustering-Algorithm-Test-Application
An application that lets you test different point clustering algorithms like K-Means, Affinity Propagation, DBSCAN and many more.
In this repository I have included all of the .py files responsible for all of the clustering functionality, as well .ui files for the main program and the dialog files that open by clicking on the different clustering algorithms.
The .txt files are example files that contain the data of the points that is being used by the clustering application.
