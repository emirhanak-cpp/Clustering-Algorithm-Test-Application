# Clustering-Algorithm-Test-Application
An application that lets you test different point clustering algorithms like K-Means, Affinity Propagation, DBSCAN and many more, using Python.
In this repository I have included all of the .py files responsible for all of the clustering functionality, as well as .ui files for the main program and the dialog files that open by clicking on the different clustering algorithms.
The .txt files are example files that contain the data of the points that is being used by the clustering application.
In the final release of the application, example data and doxygen documentation is added.

## How to use:
- Run 'hubAllocationUserInterface.py'
- Click on the folder icon or click on 'File' then 'Open Data' to open a .txt file containing the point data
- Select the desired clustering algorithm and determine the parameters
- Export or save the data as .jpg or .txt files respectively
